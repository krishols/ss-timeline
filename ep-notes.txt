Meet on Tuesdays at noon.

Goals as of 1/12/2021:
1. parse files based on structure to generate timeline

2. create timeline interface
    - upload file
    - ask for:
         - start date
	 - end date
	 - units of time
	 - how many problems

3. Look at CS Ed tools papers to see how they evaluate success of
   tool in classroom setting
      - controlled experiments: control and experimental groups in classroom with self-report and assessment of
      learning through given assignment grades https://dl-acm-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1145/3341525.3387390
      - case studies with instructors consisting of interviews, demonstration of tool, and questionnaires to evaluate
      the tool's success and usability https://dl-acm-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3341525.3387410
      - very qualitative analysis (in-depth interviews and recordings of participants' interactions with tool) with
      small n
      - compare outcome of exercises/assignments using the tool versus not using the tool

     - our approach: control group base case: not refined timeline
     - usability of tool from professors
     - self-report survey

Benefits of this tool:
   - provides consistency among structure assignments across the department (or all teachers that use the tool)
   - timeline provides professors the opportunity to manage their expectations of an assignment/exam, time commitments, etc.
